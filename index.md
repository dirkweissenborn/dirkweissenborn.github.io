I am a PhD student/Researcher at the [Language Technology Lab](https://www.dfki.de/lt/) of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) under the supervision of [Hans Uszkoreit](https://www.dfki.de/~hansu/) and [Feiyu Xu](http://www.dfki.de/~feiyu) since April, 2014. I worked as a Research Intern at [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com) for 5 month from May until October, 2017.

My current research interests lie in representation learning for NLP with a focus on tasks involving reading comprehension and the integration of background knowledge. However, I am generally interested in all kinds of research that in the intersection of NLP and Deep Learning. In the past, I did work on Word Sense Disambiguation & Entity Linking.

I graduated with a diploma degree from the computer science faculty of the TU Dresden, Germany, in 2014. During my diploma thesis, I worked on relation discovery between indirectly connected biomedical concepts at the [bioinformatics group](http://www.biotec.tu-dresden.de/research/schroeder/) of Michael Schroeder.

Besides my academic work I have also been actively involved in open-source projects. Most recently, I have been working as one of the main developers on [Jack the Reader](https://github.com/uclmr/jack), a neural machine reading library that aims at facilitating research for tasks that involve machine reading. I was also involved in [DBpedia Spotlight](https://github.com/dbpedia-spotlight/dbpedia-spotlight), a library for entity linking, as both [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) student and mentor.
