I am a PhD student/Researcher at the [Language Technology Lab](http://www.dfki.de/lt/) of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) under the supervision of [Hans Uszkoreit](http://www.dfki.de/~hansu/) and [Feiyu Xu](http://www.dfki.de/~feiyu).

My current research interests lie in representation learning for NLP with a focus on memory enhanced neural language models. I did also work on Word Sense Disambiguation and Entity Linking.

I graduated with a diploma degree from the computer science faculty of the TU Dresden, Germany, in 2014. During my diploma thesis, I worked on relation discovery between indirectly connected biomedical concepts at the [bioinformatics group](http://www.biotec.tu-dresden.de/research/schroeder/) of Michael Schroeder.
